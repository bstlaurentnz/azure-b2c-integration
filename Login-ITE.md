### Azure Active Directory B2C - RealMe Login service - ITE Integration

This wiki explains how to integrate Real Me Login in the RealMe ITE environment:

1. Purchase a certificate: it will be used to sign the SAML requests.
2. Follow the integration steps as describe for the MTS environment but use your own cert rather than using the certificate provided by RealMe (`mts_mutual_ssl_sp.pfx`).
